# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

## 📂 Overview

This project performs binary image classification to distinguish between images of **cats and dogs** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model. The entire pipeline—from data preprocessing to training and evaluation—is implemented in the Jupyter notebook `prodigy_ml_task3.ipynb`.
